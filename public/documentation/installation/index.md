# Installation

To deploy your first opeNode site, you first need to get our command line interface, it's simple and easy to get started. It is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and you can install it via:

    npm install -g openode

Don't have npm and node ? Make sure to get it, it takes 2 minutes:

- **Linux + Mac**: [Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation), then [install node](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage).
- **Windows**: Install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Once you have npm and node installed, you can get started right away, by first going to your
project folder:

    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>

Finally, you can start using openode, for example by typing the following command to deploy
your first instance:

    openode deploy
