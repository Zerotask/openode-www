# Addons

Addons are attached services to your main instance. Typical examples are: caching systems, databases, etc.

## Manage Addons via the Administration

Addons can be added or removed via the administration, under Settings. Once created, they are deployed automatically when you deploy your instance. You can access them using their name (hostname).
